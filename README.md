## Lyrics

```

I'm still branched thr with a narrative of rules
It's a sacriledge of fools, better quit while you good
I'm just done with the aforementioned bending of the rules

Sickening is round round round
Blood is circling round the crown 
Shots are heard through to dawn



Sickos stuck all around
abound round and round

```
