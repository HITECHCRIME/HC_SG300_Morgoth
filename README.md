## Lyrics

```

I'm still branched with a narrative of rules
Just a sacriledge of fools, better quit while you good
I am truly done with morbid bending of the dues

Sickening is round round round
Blood is circling round the crown 
Shots are heard through to dawn



Sickos stuck all around
abound round and round

```
